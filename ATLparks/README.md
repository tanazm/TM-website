Disparities in accessing Atlanta's green spaces

Goals: I looked at where green spaces in Atlanta's 12 City Council Districts are located to determine whether there's a relationship between the number of parks in each District and the demographic composition of that District.

Findings: I learned that there is a slight relationship between the number of parks in a District and race. Specifically, Districts where approximately 90 percent or more of residents are Black have the fewest number of green spaces.

What I'd like to do next: conduct the same analysis on a more granular level by using neighborhoods rather than City Countil Districts.
